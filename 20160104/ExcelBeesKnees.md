#Excel is the Bees Knees

##Moment
Excel + VBA to the rescue, generating 1000 line derived JSON data from Hexidecimal values.

##Background Story
I started as a new member of an existing GraphQL open source project with < 5 members.

I was reading but cognitive processes were not keeping up. 
>Understanding versus Consuming data - post for another time.

Decided to start small on a specific job where I had some familiarity with the data as a way of `dipping my toes in the water`.
